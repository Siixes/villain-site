This is a blog I keep to write about stuff. Most of the time it is related to computer security, but in actuality it's just about how I think. Sometimes I go down mental rabbit holes, then I end up chaining rabbit holes and end up at some odd conclusion. Then when I write about that conclusion it may not make sense because I write about it as if it's self-evident, not including the path that lead there. Feel free to call me out on this when it happens, I can take it.
